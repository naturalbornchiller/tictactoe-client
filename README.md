# Development Process
My initial desires for the project were lofty (I wanted to implement AI and
multiplayer) and I soon bumped up against my own inexperience (in the form of
bugs and design constraints), at which point I re-scoped my project. Though a
bit disappointing, this was the right choice. My finished project is very bare
bones. It is not beautiful, but minimal, functional. I learned a considerable
amount about how to effectively troubleshoot (this became apparent after assisting
some of my peers in finding solutions for their bugs and features). In addition,
I gained a more limpid understanding of the processes of programming, and of how
html, css, and js can be used in concert to generate dynamic, sophisticated SPAs.

# Future Goals
There are many things that I would like to do with this site that I don't know
how, or haven't yet had time, to implement. To start, the AI. I followed a
tutorial of the minimax function online and understand it. That said, I haven't
had time to connect my AI logic files to the DOM and I fear doing so last minute
would produce more bugs than I have time to squash. Next, I would like to beautify
the ui. There is a lot lacking in terms of "sleek"ness; honestly it looks like
it hasn't been updated since the early 90s. Specifically, making account management
be accessed through modals would be nice; fonts and colors definitely need help,
as well as general positioning (I still don't understand how to properly use
float, flex, and grid). Lastly, doing a version of Ultimate tic-tac-toe would
be super fun to think through.
